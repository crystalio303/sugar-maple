# Sugar Maple Health
Sugar maple health is declining in the northeast where they dominate some types of forest. They provide spectacular fall foilage and provide shade for landscape and produce maple syrup. How do we know that sugar maple health is declining? We look at a few different indicators of tree health in one project and will be looking at soil composition in the second.

*Analysis forthcoming*

I want to analyze across some newly added datasets.
